# Binary Basics Tutorial
## By: Stefan Tomovski


#### Description
The purpose of this tutorial is to help people learn binary. My target audience for this tutorial is for anyone who desires a better understanding in binary. This tutorial is meant to cover the basics so it'll fit the needs of most beginners. Although binary isn't a necessity for the field of Information Technology it is very useful to understand the languages computers speak in.

## What is Binary?
**Binary** - a number system that revolves around the number 2 rather than 10

*Binary* uses 2 digits. 1 and 0. To count in Binary the number 1 would go in the first ones place and look like 000001 to count to the number 2, the 1 moves to the second place as such: 000010

### Addition In Binary
Adding in Binary is simple. The equation 1+1 in binary is equal to 10. This may sound wierd but the reason to this is the one represents the two's column so the one in the second place is equal to 2. 

1010 + 11 = 1101

To add these together you add them by stacking them as you do when you add them in decimal systems
You start by adding the 1 and the zero at the start all the way to the right. The next digit gets added to the one and you carry the 1 over to the next column.

### Subtraction In Binary
Subtraction in binary is simple and similar to subtracting in the decimal system. To subtract in binary you want to stack your two numbers like you would in a decimal problem and subtract as normally. 0 subtracted from 1 gives you 1 but when 1 is subtracted from zero you want to use a familiar concept called borrowing from the next highest digit.

### Multiplication In Binary
Multiplication in binary is simple and exactly like multiplying in the decimal system. You want to stack the numbers and multiply the first bottom most right digit times each top digit and do this for each bottom number. As you move from each bottom number you want to displace the numbers by 1 to the right as if you are multiplying two large decimal numbers as such:

### Division In Binary
Division in binary is a bit more complicated than the other mathmatical operators but it is exactly the same as decimal long division
Step 1: First observe the first two numbers in dividend and compare with divisor. Add 1 into quotient place and subtrac the value.
Step 2: Bring down number and repeat step 1
Step 3: Repeat process until remainder becomes 0
Step 4: Bring down 0 into quotient portion
