## What is Binary?
**Binary** - a number system that revolves around the number 2 rather than 10

*Binary* uses 2 digits. 1 and 0. To count in Binary the number 1 would go in the first ones place and look like 000001 to count to the number 2, the 1 moves to the second place as such: 000010

### Addition In Binary
Adding in Binary is simple. The equation 1+1 in binary is equal to 10. This may sound wierd but the reason to this is the one represents the two's column so the one in the second place is equal to 2. 

1010 + 11 = 1101

To add these together you add them by stacking them as you do when you add them in decimal systems
You start by adding the 1 and the zero at the start all the way to the right. The next digit gets added to the one and you carry the 1 over to the next column.
